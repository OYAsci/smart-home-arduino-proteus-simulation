-----------SIMULATION :--------
for this we have only two essential files:
              - .pdsprj : it's the proteus file, modify it to suit your needs but note that you'll need to modify the code as well.
              - .hex : it's the code in hexagonal format (ready to go) link the directory of this file after downloading it directly to the Arduino board on Proteus than hit run.
ther's the .ino file it's the originl arduino code that you can modify to suit your own project.
----------realization : ------
for this part i've shared only the codes in each code you can have the full picture of the prototype, so for that you may consider reading the code to know which pin to each task. 
as for these codes : they should be uploaded to the Arduino through the usb port directly from the Arduino IDE program.
